I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Merced.

My primary research interests are in Labor and Public Economics, with a focus on the Economics of the Family, the Economics of Education, and the Economics of Crime.

I work with restricted-use administrative data that link individual-level records across education, birth certificates, crime incidents, and voter files. These longitudinal, geocoded datasets allow me to track individuals and families over time to answer questions related to education, residential mobility, civic participation, and intra-household decision-making.

I will be entering the 2025â€“2026 academic job market.
