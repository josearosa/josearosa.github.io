I am an Ecnomics PhD Candidate from the University of California, Merced. 

My main interests are Labor and Public Economics with an emphasis on the Economics of the Family,Economics of Education, and Economics of Crime.

I work with restricted-use administrative data that link individual-level records across education, birth records, crime incidents, and voter files. These longitudinal, geocoded datasets allow me to track individuals and families over time, that answers questions related to education, residential patterns, civic participation, and intra-household decision-making. 

I will be entering the 2025-2026 Job Market.
