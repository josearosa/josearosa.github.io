Reduced special education access for one child reveals overlooked sibling benefits, exposing hidden family spillovers from targeted education policies.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Over 13% of U.S. children receive special education (SpEd) services, which often involve substantial
changes in educational investments for the identified child. However, little is known about how
these services affect other children in the household. We study sibling spillovers using a 2005 Texas
policy that capped district-level SpEd enrollment at 8.5%, resulting in abrupt declines in access.
Leveraging linked birth and education records, we examine how reduced SpEd access for one child
affects their siblings. We find that having a sibling more likely to lose SpEd leads to improvements
in the non-disabled siblingâ€™s long-run outcomes. These spillovers are unlikely to stem from direct
sibling interactions and instead appear to reflect changes in parental investments. The magnitudes
of these effects are substantial and highlight the importance of accounting for family spillovers in
evaluating targeted programs, which often focus only on direct impacts.

Voter turnout rises after nearby murders but declines following robberies, revealing distinct political reactions to different forms of violent crime.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This paper investigates the impact of exposure to violent crime on voter turnout using geocoded crime and voter registration data from Houston, Texas. Leveraging an event-study difference-in-differences design, we compare individuals exposed to crimes just before the 2016 election to those exposed shortly after, isolating plausibly exogenous variation in proximity and timing. We find heterogeneous effects: exposure to extreme violence, such as murder, increases turnout, particularly among non-partisan voters, while crimes like robbery may suppress participation. The findings suggest that recent encounters with violence can mobilize or demobilize political behavior, depending on crime type and individual affiliation.

Same-sex sibling effects significantly increase marriage rates and timing for men in the U.S, with strong heterogeniety across race and sex.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This paper examines the effect of sibling sex composition on marriage outcomes in the United
States using a, newly-constructed dataset from Texas covering individuals born between 1976-
1997. Leveraging both singleton and twin analyses, we find robust evidence that having a same-sex
sibling significantly increases the likelihood of marriage and accelerates marriage timing. We also
reveal substantial heterogeneity across racial groups with White individuals consistently showing
strong effects. Furthermore, we document that sibling sex effects on marriage is predominantly
present in wealthier counties. Our results highlight the importance of considering both racial
background and socioeconomic context when studying family formation patterns.
