Reduced special education access for one child reveals overlooked sibling benefits, exposing hidden family spillovers from targeted education policies.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Over 13% of U.S. children receive special education (SpEd) services, yet little is known about their impact on siblings. We study sibling spillovers using a 2005 Texas policy that capped district-level SpEd enrollment at 8.5%, leading to sharp declines in access. Linking birth and education records, we find that when one child is more likely to lose SpEd services, their general education sibling experiences improved long-run outcomes. Although these effects likely reflect a combination of changes in parental investment and direct sibling interactions, the evidence more strongly supports parental resource reallocation than direct sibling spillovers. Our results imply that evaluations of targeted education programs like SpEd should account for family spillovers and not just the treated child outcomes.

Understanding the relationship between violent criminal activity and voter participation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This paper estimates how exposure to nearby criminal activity affects electoral participation using administrative, geocoded data from Texas linked to the 2016 general election. Leveraging the quasi-random timing of incidents relative to Election Day, we combine a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) with difference-in-differences analysis that compares voters living close to murders occurring just before the election to observationally similar neighbors exposed just after. We find that pre-election exposure to murders decreases turnout. Demobilization is concentrated among younger voters, unaffiliated/non-partisan registrants, and for incidents that occur during daytime hours, consistent with salience and risk-perception channels that raise the perceived costs of voting. Effects are most pronounced for individuals residing nearest to the incident location and attenuate with distance from the murder and time from the election

Same-sex sibling effects significantly increase marriage rates and timing for men in the U.S, with strong heterogeniety across race and sex.  
</div>
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This paper examines the effect of sibling sex composition on marriage outcomes in the United
States using a, newly-constructed dataset from Texas covering individuals born between 1976-
1997. Leveraging both singleton and twin analyses, we find robust evidence that having a same-sex
sibling significantly increases the likelihood of marriage and accelerates marriage timing. We also
reveal substantial heterogeneity across racial groups with White individuals consistently showing
strong effects. Furthermore, we document that sibling sex effects on marriage is predominantly
present in wealthier counties. Our results highlight the importance of considering both racial
background and socioeconomic context when studying family formation patterns.
