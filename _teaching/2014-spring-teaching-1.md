## Student Feedback Highlights

> “Jose is well respected amongst the students — he earned that through his passion for helping us with our academic needs. He efficiently summarized difficult material and provided helpful problem-solving tips. He was flexible with scheduling, prioritized student feedback, and made adjustments based on it. I truly believe he would be an impactful instructor on campus if he ever becomes a professor.”

> “Jose was a great instructor and tried very hard to keep the class interactive, which I understand can be difficult in a remote class. He asked many questions to keep us engaged, and I enjoyed participating.”  
> — *Intermediate Microeconomics, Summer 2024*

> “The TA was very helpful. He always went over anything if you needed him to. For homework assignments, he held extra office hours so anyone who needed help could get it. He was always respectful, easy to talk to, and went above and beyond. Before midterms, he offered additional study sessions and accommodated everyone’s schedule.”

## Teaching Philosophy

I strive to create an intellectually rigorous classroom environment that centers applied problem-solving, critical thinking, and peer collaboration. As a first-generation college student, I am especially committed to fostering equity in learning by demystifying complex topics, using real-world datasets, and supporting students through clear communication and high standards.
