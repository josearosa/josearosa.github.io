## Student Feedback Highlights

> *“Jose is well respected amongst the students, that is because he earned it through his passion in helping the students with their academic needs. He is able to efficiently summarize down the difficult materials throughout the course and provide the students with helpful tips when solving problems. He has a good working ethics, which he always tries to be flexible with the student's available time and prioritize the feedback from the students and make adjustments on himself. I truly believe he can be an impactful instructor on the campus if he ever becomes a professor.”*

> *“Jose was a great instructor and tried very hard to keep the class interactive which I understand can be difficult in a remote class. He asked many questions to keep us engaged and I enjoyed participating.”*
> - *Intermediate Microeconomics, Summer 2024 



> *“The TA was very helpful. Would always go over anything if you needed him too. When it came for homework assignments always made
extra office hours so anyone who needed extra help they had it. Was very nice and always respected everyone, he was easy to get along
with. I recommend having him as a TA. He always did above then what he had to do. When we would all study for the midterm he would
hold extra office hours for that too. He would always accommodate everyones busy schedules.”*  
> — *Econometrics, Fall 2023*

> *“Jose is GREAT! He's a really good TA and his discussions are super helpful in understanding and digesting the material because
sometimes the lecture can be very info-heavy and hard to understand. He tries to help us and his discussions are always very detailed and
well prepared to help us with important topics in class.
His pre-midterm and final lectures were super helpful in preparing us for answering short answer questions and goes above and beyond to
help us, which I really appreciate.”*

## Teaching Philosophy

I strive to create an  intellectually rigorous classroom environment that centers applied problem-solving, critical thinking, and peer collaboration. As a first-generation college student, I am especially committed to fostering equity in learning by demystifying complex topics, using real-world datasets, and supporting students through clear communication and high standards.
