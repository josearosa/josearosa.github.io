## Teaching Philosophy

I strive to create an inclusive and intellectually rigorous classroom environment that centers applied problem-solving, critical thinking, and peer collaboration. As a first-generation college student, I am especially committed to fostering equity in learning by demystifying complex topics, using real-world datasets, and supporting students through clear communication and high standards.
